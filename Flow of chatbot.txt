	ankle fracture
		Encourage the person to stop moving and assess the situation. If there's severe pain, swelling, or deformity, it may indicate a fracture.
		Ask the person to keep the ankle as still as possible. You can use a splint or improvise with rigid materials (such as boards or rolled-up newspapers) to support the ankle and minimize movement.
		If possible, help the person elevate their leg to reduce swelling. This involves raising the leg so that it's higher than the heart.
		Use a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth on the injured area to help reduce swelling. Apply it for 15-20 minutes at a time with breaks in between.

	cardiac arrest
		Dial emergency services immediately.(1919)
		If the person is unresponsive and not breathing normally, begin CPR. This involves chest compressions at a rate of about 100-120 compressions per minute. If you're trained in CPR, include rescue breaths.
		If an AED is available, use it as soon as possible. Follow the device's instructions.
		Keep performing CPR and using the AED until professional help arrives or the person starts breathing on their own.

	drowning
		Make sure the area is safe for both you and the victim.

		If the person is breathing but has water in their airway, encourage them to cough. If they can't cough effectively, perform back blows and abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) if trained to do so.
		If the person is breathing, place them in the recovery position to aid breathing.
		Keep monitoring the person's breathing and other vital signs until professional help arrives.

	Burns and scalds
		For heat-related burns, immediately remove the person from the source of heat.
		If chemicals are involved, rinse the affected area with cool running water for at least 20 minutes.
		Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water for at least 10 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.
		If running water is not available, use a cold compress or immerse the area in cool water.
		Remove tight clothing and jewelry from around the burn area.
		Use a sterile, non-stick bandage or clean cloth to cover the burn. Avoid using adhesive bandages directly on the burn.
		Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can be used according to the recommended dosage.
		Seek professional medical help for burns that are severe, cover a large area, or involve the face, hands, feet, genitals, or major joints.
